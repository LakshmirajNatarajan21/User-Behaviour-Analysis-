# Facilitating Customers Towards Product Subscription in Fin-Tech Applications Through Behavioral Analysis


## Overview
This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for my MSc Research Project at the National College of Ireland. The project focuses on using behavioral analysis and machine learning to predict customer subscriptions for premium services in a financial technology (FinTech) application.

## Objective
To analyze user interaction metrics in a FinTech app and develop a predictive model that identifies potential premium subscribers, helping optimize marketing strategies and reduce customer acquisition costs.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation of user interaction data.
Model Development: Built and tested multiple neural network models to improve prediction accuracy.
Techniques Used: Regularization, K-Fold Cross-Validation, and Ensemble Learning.
Insights: Identified key user behavior patterns and financial constraints impacting subscription likelihood.

## Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
Development Environment: Google Colab
